In this project, I have analyzed the data and performing various tasks using these datasets. One of the datasets focuses on normalizing and rescaling data, while the other dataset is known as the Boston Housing dataset. By working on these datasets, I will gain insights and extract valuable information to answer the given questions.

1. Normalizing and Rescaling Data:
In this part of the project, the focus is on normalizing and rescaling data. The goal is to standardize the heights of baseball players by finding the mean and standard deviation of the height values. The provided formula `height_s = (height - mean) / std` is used to normalize the heights. The resulting numpy array `height_s` is printed as the output.

2. Boston Housing Dataset:
The Boston Housing dataset contains information about various factors affecting the median value of owner-occupied homes in different census tracts in Boston. The dataset consists of two main components: attributes (`attr`) and the median value of owner-occupied homes (`medV`).

In this part of the project, I have to perform various tasks using the Boston Housing dataset:

- Question 2.1 Print the 10th row of the `attr` array.
- Question 2.2 Print the average number of rooms per dwelling (`RM`) for the 20th tract.
- Question 2.3 Print all observations with median values smaller than 6.
- Question 2.4 Print the average pupil-teacher ratio (`PTRATIO`) for towns with median values smaller than 20.
- Question 2.5 Print specific attributes (`INDUS`, `TAX`, and `LSTAT`) for the first 5 towns.

Additionally, there is a third part to the project:

3. Arithmetic Computation for List Elements:
Write a function my_f(a) that takes a list a as input and computes 6x2 + 2 for every element x
in the list a, so that if we execute the following codes, the printed output will be [ 8 56 152].
Complete the definition of my_f function

Overall, this project provides an opportunity to practice data analysis techniques, including normalizing and rescaling data, working with the Boston Housing dataset, and performing arithmetic computations on list elements.
